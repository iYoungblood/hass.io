# LG LD650EAL 65-pint dehumidifier on a TP-Link Smart WiFi Plug Mini
#
# This dehumidifier is fast, less noisy than most and will auto-restart to its
# last condition in case of a power outage. This is great since we'll be
# controlling it with a smart power outlet. Its humistat is not used however:
# the device is run in continuous mode with humidity monitored by sensors
# throughout the dwelling. Automations take care of turning it on or off based
# on custom minimum and maximum humidity levels.
